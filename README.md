# GIchat 3.0

The definitive version of GIchat, after the Tkinter client of 1.0, and PyQt client of 2.0, client 3.0 now uses Godot Engine.
The server uses raw Python TCP sockets, JSON for data transfer, and YAML for configuration.

The server and client are on separate branches in this repo, [client](https://github.com/HazmatPants/GIchat/tree/client) and [server](https://github.com/HazmatPants/GIchat/tree/server).
